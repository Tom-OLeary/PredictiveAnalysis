# Predictive Analysis in Baseball
This project predicts the likelihood a pitcher will surrender a hit given a specific batter/pitcher matchup event.
This is my first ever machine learning/data analysis type project, so I am sure there's plenty of fine tuning to be
 done. This was completed in about 5 weeks.
 
# Statistics
* For this analysis I have made use of the lahman database and the chadwick tools. 
* The lahman database provides
 historical baseball statistics through the year 2016. 
* The chadwick tools are to be used in conjunction with chadwick event files. These event files provide play-by-play
 statistics for every recorded baseball game. These tools are required in order to parse and access the data stored
  in these files.

# Requirements: 
Python3, sqlite, matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Pandas

# Files:
    > analysis - Main file for collecting data, running the program
    > calculations - Holds calculations for statistics
    > get_data - SQL queries
    > grids - Parameters for classifiers
    > models - Preparing and testing models
    > visualize - Functions for visualizing the data
